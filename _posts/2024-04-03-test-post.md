It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

### Summary

Summary: Virginia's legislature passed a budget bill that would impose a sales tax on digital goods and some digital services starting in January 2025. This tax would apply to things like downloads, streaming services, and software, similar to the tax currently placed on physical goods.  

There was some debate about whether businesses would also be taxed on their digital purchases. In the end, the compromise exempts business purchases of most digital services, but not software applications. The bill now goes to the governor for his approval. 


Virginians, get ready to pay a bit extra for your digital fix! The state legislature recently passed a budget bill that expands the sales tax to cover "digital personal property" and certain digital services, starting January 1, 2025. This means your e-books, music downloads, streaming subscriptions, and software purchases could all be subject to the state's sales tax rate, which can vary depending on your locality but generally sits around 5.3%.

### Sales Tax

Think of it this way: if you buy a physical book in a store, you pay sales tax. Now, buying an e-book would be treated similarly. This creates a more level playing field between physical and digital products.

### Ditigal Services

But wait, there's more! The bill also includes some digital services, though there was some debate about how far to extend the tax. Businesses can breathe a sigh of relief for now, as most of their digital service purchases (like website hosting or data storage) won't be taxed. However, software applications, a key tool for many businesses, will be subject to the sales tax.

### Glenn Youngkin

So, what happens next? The bill now heads to Governor Glenn Youngkin's desk. He has 30 days to review it, and he can either sign it into law, propose amendments, or veto it altogether.


### Takeaways
Here are some key takeaways:

Starting January 1, 2025: Virginians will likely pay sales tax on digital products like ebooks, music downloads, and software.
Streaming services: Prepare to potentially pay a little extra for your Netflix or Hulu subscriptions.
Businesses: Most business-to-business digital service purchases are exempt, but software applications will be taxed.
Wait and see: Governor Youngkin will have the final say on whether the bill becomes law.
This new tax could bring in additional revenue for the state, but it's also sure to spark some debate. Stay tuned for further updates as the bill makes its way through the final approval process!
